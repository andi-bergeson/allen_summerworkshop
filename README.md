Welcome! This works with the newest Minnie 65 data release and is focused on cleaning the data for what you need and generating various plots that display synaptic probability with respect to lateral distance.

For installation, run:

`python -m pip install -e .`

This will install this as a python package in the current environment. You can make edits (with `-e`) and any changes will be reflected when saved!
Then run:

`python setup.py develop`

This will run setup.py so you have the dependencies, and develop will create an .egg-info folder and let you modify the rest of the meta-data.

For examples, please see my [Confidence Interval Plotting Notebook](https://github.com/andi-bergeson/allen_summerworkshop/blob/main/notebooks/confidenceinterval_plotting.ipynb)
